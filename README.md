## What's this? 
 - This is a little website made using ReactJS and TypeScript which produces all the possibilites for Logical Expressions! 
 
 - the idea came to me in a Logic Design course where I was first introduced to Boolean Algebra, I looked and found that there was already a similar website by [Stanford    University](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs103/tools/truth-table-tool/).
 
 - I wondered how it was made, and finally we're here
 
 - The project is also me trying out TS

## Example
A & B

| A | B | Result|
|-|-|-|
|false|false|false|
|false|true|false|
|true|false|false|
|true|true|true|

A & !B | ( C | A )


|a|b|c|     result           |
|-|-|-|----------------------|
|false|	false|	false|	false|
|false|	false|	true |	true |
|false|	true |	false|	false|
|false|	true |	true |	true |
|true |	false|	false|	true |
|true |	false|	true |	true |
|true |	true |	false|	true |
|true |	true |	true |	true |
